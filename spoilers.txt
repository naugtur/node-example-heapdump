Ex1 ----------------------------------------------


app.get('/dump', (req, res) => {
  const heapdump = require('heapdump')
  heapdump.writeSnapshot(function (err, filename) {
    if (err) {
      console.log('oops, ', err)
    } else {
      console.log('dump written to', filename)
    }
    res.end()
  })
})

WARNING: if you expose triggering heapdump as a http request, make sure it's not
         publically available. I recommend it's on a separate port that you only
         route in local network

Once you have heap snapshots, load them into memory tab in chrome/chromium
devtools in chronological order, select the newer one and switch mode (top left)
to Compare. Expand two top items on the list (biggest size) and select first
item on each list. You should quickly find the `blowingUp` reference with large
retained size.

Ex2 ----------------------------------------------

The analysis starts the same as above, but once you find the item with lots of
retained size, you need to explore where it's referenced. The tree is
automatically expanded, you need to close some branches sometimes to find more
references without scrolling down for a few minutes.

The offending code is related to MemoryStore inside of express-session, which
is a pretend implementation of session store. With default settings (the
deprecated ones it's been warning about from the start) every call without
cookies creates a new session entry, which is never cleaned up in MemoryStore.
